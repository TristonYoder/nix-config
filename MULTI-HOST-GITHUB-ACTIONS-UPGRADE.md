# Multi-Host GitHub Actions Upgrade Summary

## Overview

Your GitHub Actions workflows have been upgraded to support **multi-host testing and deployment**. This allows automatic deployment to all your NixOS hosts in parallel when tests pass.

## What Changed

### 1. Test Workflow (`test-nixos-config.yml`)

**Before:**
- Tested only the `david` host
- Used hardcoded `NIXOS_SERVER_HOSTNAME` secret
- Single job execution

**After:**
- Tests **all NixOS hosts in parallel**: `david`, `pits`, `tristons-desk`
- Added flake syntax check job (runs first for fast failure)
- Uses matrix strategy for parallel execution
- Each host tested independently
- Failure in one host doesn't stop others (`fail-fast: false`)

**Key Changes:**
```yaml
# Added flake syntax check
check-flake-syntax:
  - Install Nix locally
  - Run nix flake check --all-systems

# Matrix strategy for all hosts
test-configurations:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      host: 
        - name: david
          hostname: david
        - name: pits
          hostname: pits
        - name: tristons-desk
          hostname: tristons-desk
    fail-fast: false
```

### 2. Deploy Workflow (`deploy-nixos-config.yml`)

**Before:**
- Deployed only to `david` host
- Automatic deployment on main branch only
- Used hardcoded `NIXOS_SERVER_HOSTNAME` secret

**After:**
- Deploys to **all NixOS hosts in parallel**
- Added manual trigger with host selection (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Supports deploying to specific hosts: `david,pits` or `all`
- Each deployment runs independently
- Added deployment summary job

**Key Changes:**
```yaml
# Manual trigger with host selection
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    hosts:
      description: 'Comma-separated list of hosts (e.g., david,pits or "all")'
      default: 'all'

# Determine which hosts to deploy
prepare-deployment:
  outputs:
    hosts: ${{ steps.set-hosts.outputs.hosts }}

# Matrix deployment
deploy-configurations:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      host: ${{ fromJson(needs.prepare-deployment.outputs.hosts) }}
    fail-fast: false
```

### 3. Documentation

**New Files:**
- `README-GitHub-Actions-MultiHost.md` - Complete multi-host deployment guide
- `MULTI-HOST-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Quick reference guide
- `MULTI-HOST-GITHUB-ACTIONS-UPGRADE.md` - This file

**Updated Files:**
- `README-GitHub-Actions.md` - Added multi-host references
- `README.md` - Added multi-host feature and documentation links

## Features

### ✅ What You Get

1. **Parallel Testing**
   - All hosts tested simultaneously
   - Faster feedback on configuration changes
   - Independent test results per host

2. **Parallel Deployment**
   - All hosts deployed at the same time
   - Reduced total deployment time
   - Independent deployment per host

3. **Selective Deployment**
   - Deploy to all hosts: `all`
   - Deploy to specific hosts: `david,pits`
   - Manual trigger anytime

4. **Fail-Safe**
   - One host failure doesn't affect others
   - Each host maintains its own backup
   - Independent rollback per host

5. **Fast Feedback**
   - Flake syntax check runs first
   - Catches errors before testing on hosts
   - Saves time and resources

## Migration Guide

### What You Need to Do

#### 1. Update GitHub Secrets (Optional)

The old `NIXOS_SERVER_HOSTNAME` secret is **no longer used**. You can:
- Leave it (won't cause issues)
- Delete it (cleanup)

**Required secrets** (no changes needed if already set):
- `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` ✅
- `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_SECRET` ✅
- `NIXOS_SERVER_USER` ✅
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` ✅

#### 2. Ensure All Hosts are Configured

Each host needs:

**a. GitHub Actions module enabled:**
```nix
# In host configuration or profile
modules.services.development.github-actions.enable = true;
```

**b. SSH key authorized:**
- The `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` in GitHub secrets must work on all hosts
- The module automatically authorizes the key (default or custom)

**c. Tailscale connected:**
```bash
# On each host
sudo tailscale status
```

**d. Apply configuration:**
```bash
# On each host
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

#### 3. Test the Setup

**Option 1: Test on a feature branch (recommended)**
```bash
git checkout -b test/multi-host-deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Test multi-host deployment"
git push origin test/multi-host-deployment
```
- This will run tests on all hosts
- No deployment happens (not on main branch)
- Verify all hosts pass tests

**Option 2: Manual deployment to one host**
1. Go to GitHub → Actions
2. Select "Deploy NixOS Flake Configuration"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter: `david` (just one host)
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Monitor the deployment

**Option 3: Full deployment**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge test/multi-host-deployment
git push origin main
```
- Tests run on all hosts
- If all pass, deploys to all hosts automatically
- Monitor closely for first run

## Current Configuration

### Managed Hosts

```yaml
hosts:
  - david          # Main server
  - pits           # Edge VPS
  - tristons-desk  # Desktop workstation
```

### Deployment Flow

```
Push to main
    ↓
Test all hosts (parallel)
    ↓
All tests pass?
    ↓
Deploy to all hosts (parallel)
    ↓
Success! ✅
```

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Deployment

```bash
# Make changes to any host configuration
vim hosts/pits/configuration.nix

# Commit and push to main
git add .
git commit -m "Update pits configuration"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Tests all hosts (including pits)
# 2. Deploys to all hosts if tests pass
```

### Manual Deployment to All Hosts

1. GitHub → Actions
2. "Deploy NixOS Flake Configuration"
3. "Run workflow"
4. Hosts: `all` (default)
5. "Run workflow"

### Manual Deployment to Specific Hosts

1. GitHub → Actions
2. "Deploy NixOS Flake Configuration"
3. "Run workflow"
4. Hosts: `david,pits`
5. "Run workflow"

### Test Without Deployment

```bash
# Push to any branch except main
git checkout -b feature/new-service
git add .
git commit -m "Add new service"
git push origin feature/new-service

# Tests run, no deployment
```

## Customization

### Add a New Host

**1. Add to flake.nix** (already done if host exists):
```nix
nixosConfigurations.new-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
  # ... configuration
};
```

**2. Add to test workflow** (`.github/workflows/test-nixos-config.yml`):
```yaml
matrix:
  host: 
    - name: new-host
      hostname: new-host
```

**3. Add to deploy workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-nixos-config.yml`):
```yaml
ALL_HOSTS='["david", "pits", "tristons-desk", "new-host"]'
```

### Remove a Host

**From testing and deployment:**
Remove from both workflow files.

**From deployment only:**
Keep in test workflow, remove from deploy workflow's `ALL_HOSTS`.

### Deploy to Servers Only

**Exclude desktop from automatic deployment:**

In `.github/workflows/deploy-nixos-config.yml`:
```yaml
ALL_HOSTS='["david", "pits"]'  # Removed tristons-desk
```

Desktop can still be:
- Tested automatically
- Deployed manually by specifying `tristons-desk`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow uses old single-host behavior

**Cause:** Workflows not updated or using old commit

**Solution:**
```bash
git pull origin main
# Verify workflow files are updated
cat .github/workflows/test-nixos-config.yml | grep matrix
```

### Issue: Host not found in matrix

**Cause:** Host not added to workflow matrix

**Solution:** Add host to both workflow matrices (see "Add a New Host" above)

### Issue: SSH authentication fails on one host

**Cause:** SSH key not authorized on that host

**Solution:**
```bash
# On the failing host
ssh github-actions@hostname

# Check authorized keys
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# If missing, apply configuration
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

### Issue: All hosts fail with "hostname not found"

**Cause:** Hosts not on Tailscale or wrong hostnames

**Solution:**
```bash
# On each host
sudo tailscale status

# Verify hostname matches matrix
hostname
```

## Benefits

### Before (Single Host)

- ❌ Only `david` tested and deployed
- ❌ Other hosts must be manually updated
- ❌ Inconsistent configurations
- ❌ No parallel execution
- ❌ Manual effort for each host

### After (Multi Host)

- ✅ All hosts tested automatically
- ✅ All hosts deployed in parallel
- ✅ Consistent configurations everywhere
- ✅ Faster overall deployment
- ✅ Automated for all hosts
- ✅ Selective deployment available
- ✅ Independent failure handling

## Performance

### Test Workflow

**Before:**
- ~2-3 minutes for one host
- Sequential testing if multiple hosts

**After:**
- ~2-3 minutes for all hosts (parallel)
- Flake check adds ~30 seconds

**Improvement:** ~5-9 minutes saved for 3 hosts

### Deploy Workflow

**Before:**
- ~3-5 minutes per host
- Manual trigger for each additional host

**After:**
- ~3-5 minutes for all hosts (parallel)
- Single trigger for all hosts

**Improvement:** ~6-15 minutes saved for 3 hosts

## Security Considerations

### Same as Before

- ✅ Tailscale secure network
- ✅ SSH key authentication
- ✅ GitHub Actions user with sudo
- ✅ Automatic backups

### New Considerations

- ✅ Same SSH key works on all hosts (already required)
- ✅ Each host maintains independent backups
- ✅ Failed deployment doesn't affect other hosts
- ✅ Each host can be rolled back independently

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Workflows updated** (already done)
2. ⬜ **Verify all hosts configured** (check github-actions module)
3. ⬜ **Test on feature branch** (recommended first step)
4. ⬜ **Manual deployment to one host** (validate setup)
5. ⬜ **Full deployment to all hosts** (when ready)
6. ⬜ **Monitor first deployment** (ensure success)
7. ⬜ **Test rollback** (verify backup system)
8. ⬜ **Update documentation** (if custom setup)
