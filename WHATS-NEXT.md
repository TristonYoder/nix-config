# 🚀 What's Next: Multi-Host GitHub Actions Deployment

Your repository has been updated with **multi-host GitHub Actions deployment**! Here's what you need to know and do next.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Workflows Updated

**Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test-nixos-config.yml`):
- ✅ Now tests all hosts in parallel: `david`, `pits`, `tristons-desk`
- ✅ Added flake syntax check (runs first)
- ✅ Independent failure handling

**Deploy Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-nixos-config.yml`):
- ✅ Deploys to all hosts in parallel
- ✅ Added manual trigger with host selection
- ✅ Deploy to all or specific hosts

### 2. Documentation Created

- ✅ `README-GitHub-Actions-MultiHost.md` - Complete guide
- ✅ `MULTI-HOST-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Quick reference
- ✅ `MULTI-HOST-GITHUB-ACTIONS-UPGRADE.md` - Upgrade summary
- ✅ `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` - Verification checklist
- ✅ `WHATS-NEXT.md` - This file
- ✅ Updated main README.md with new features

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Option A: Quick Test (Recommended)

**Just want to see it work? Do this:**

```bash
# 1. Commit the workflow changes (if not already done)
git add .
git commit -m "Add multi-host GitHub Actions deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
# 3. Watch the test workflow run on all hosts
# 4. If successful, deploy workflow runs automatically

# 5. Monitor the deployments
# All hosts should deploy in parallel
```

### Option B: Careful Verification

**Want to test carefully? Follow this path:**

#### Step 1: Verify Host Configuration

On each host (`david`, `pits`, `tristons-desk`), check:

```bash
# SSH to each host
ssh your-user@hostname

# Verify github-actions module is enabled
# Should see github-actions user exists
id github-actions

# Check Tailscale is running
sudo tailscale status

# Verify hostname
hostname
```

#### Step 2: Test on Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/multi-host-deployment

# Make a small change or just commit workflow updates
git add .
git commit -m "Test multi-host deployment"
git push origin test/multi-host-deployment

# Go to GitHub → Actions
# Watch test workflow run on all hosts
# Verify all pass
```

#### Step 3: Manual Deployment to One Host

```bash
# Go to GitHub → Actions
# Select "Deploy NixOS Flake Configuration"
# Click "Run workflow"
# Branch: test/multi-host-deployment
# Hosts: david
# Click "Run workflow"

# Monitor deployment
# Verify successful
```

#### Step 4: Full Deployment

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge test/multi-host-deployment
git push origin main

# Automatic test and deploy will run
# Monitor GitHub Actions tab
```

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] All hosts are online and on Tailscale
- [ ] GitHub secrets are configured:
  - [ ] `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
  - [ ] `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_SECRET`
  - [ ] `NIXOS_SERVER_USER`
  - [ ] `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- [ ] Each host has `github-actions` user (module enabled)
- [ ] Can SSH to each host from local machine

**Full checklist**: See [SETUP-CHECKLIST.md](SETUP-CHECKLIST.md)

## 🎬 Quick Demo

Want to see it in action right now?

### Test Workflow (Safe - No Deployment)

```bash
# Push to any branch except main
git checkout -b demo/test-multi-host
git add .
git commit -m "Demo multi-host testing"
git push origin demo/test-multi-host

# Go to GitHub → Actions
# Watch all hosts being tested in parallel
```

### Deploy Workflow (Safe - One Host)

1. GitHub → Actions
2. "Deploy NixOS Flake Configuration"
3. "Run workflow"
4. Branch: `main` (or your test branch)
5. Hosts: `david` (just one for safety)
6. "Run workflow"
7. Watch it deploy

### Full Multi-Host Deploy

1. Push to `main` branch
2. Go to GitHub → Actions
3. Watch magic happen ✨
4. All hosts test and deploy in parallel

## 📊 What to Expect

### Test Workflow

```
Push to any branch
    ↓
Flake syntax check (30 sec)
    ↓
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   david     │    pits     │ tristons-   │
│   test      │    test     │   desk test │
│  (2-3 min)  │  (2-3 min)  │  (2-3 min)  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
    ↓
All pass? ✅ or Some fail? ❌
```

**Total time**: ~3 minutes (vs ~9 minutes sequential)

### Deploy Workflow (on main branch)

```
All tests pass
    ↓
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   david     │    pits     │ tristons-   │
│   deploy    │   deploy    │  desk deploy│
│  (3-5 min)  │  (3-5 min)  │  (3-5 min)  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
    ↓
All deployed! 🎉
```

**Total time**: ~5 minutes (vs ~15 minutes sequential)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Setup

Your workflows are configured for:
- `david` - Main server
- `pits` - Edge VPS
- `tristons-desk` - Desktop

### Customize Deployment Targets

**Deploy to servers only (exclude desktop):**

Edit `.github/workflows/deploy-nixos-config.yml`:
```yaml
ALL_HOSTS='["david", "pits"]'  # Removed tristons-desk
```

**Deploy to specific hosts manually:**
Use workflow_dispatch and enter: `david,pits`

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Deployment Fails

**Don't panic!** The workflow has safeguards:

1. Each host backs up before deployment
2. One host failure doesn't affect others
3. You can rollback each host independently

**To rollback:**
```bash
ssh github-actions@hostname
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
```

### Test Fails

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Fix the configuration
3. Push again
4. Tests will re-run

### Can't Connect to Host

1. Check Tailscale: `sudo tailscale status`
2. Verify SSH: `ssh github-actions@hostname`
3. Check GitHub secrets

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test first**: Always test on feature branch before main
2. **One at a time**: First deployment? Try one host manually
3. **Monitor closely**: Watch the first full deployment
4. **Keep backups**: Automatic, but verify they're created
5. **Use manual trigger**: Deploy specific hosts when needed

## ✨ Cool Features

### 1. Parallel Everything

All hosts test and deploy **simultaneously** → Much faster!

### 2. Independent Failures

One host fails? Others continue → More resilient!

### 3. Selective Deployment

Manual trigger lets you deploy to specific hosts → More control!

### 4. Fast Feedback

Flake syntax check fails fast → Save time!

### 5. Automatic Backups

Each host backs up before deployment → Safe rollback!

## 🎯 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ GitHub Actions shows matrix jobs for each host
- ✅ All hosts run tests in parallel
- ✅ Deploy workflow triggers after test success
- ✅ All hosts deploy simultaneously
- ✅ Each host shows successful deployment
- ✅ Services running on all hosts
